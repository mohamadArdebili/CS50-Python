# GUESSING Game
## Video Demo: https://youtu.be/4kCYI9uyN28?si=doV9fdOZ7VCzKMb1
## Description:
 CS50-Python's final project is about a Guessing game that asks the user to enter a range that the computer, will randomly select a number in specified range and then makes player to play against the computer.

The program contains 7 functions, *a main* one and *6 other* functions including:
```
- intro()
- guess_limit()
- check_lower_int()
- check_upper_int()
- generate_integer()
- user_guess()
```

which gather together to make the whole project.

**Furthermore**, there's a testing file, named `test_project.py` that include 3 *unit-test* functions to check if the functions work properly. The last file called `request.txt` contains *pip-installable libraries* that used in the project.


## Structures required:
- Project must be implemented in Python.
- Project must have a main function and at least three other functions, each of which must be accompanied by tests that can be executed with pytest.
- Main function must be in a file called project.py, which should be in the “root” of the project.
- 3 required custom functions other than main must also be in project.py and defined at the same indentation level as main functions.
- The test functions must be in a file called test_project.py, which should also be in the “root” of your project. Be sure they have the same name as your custom functions, prepended with 'test_function'.
- You are welcome to implement additional classes and functions as you see fit beyond the minimum requirement.
- Implementing your project should entail more time and effort than is required by each of the course’s problem sets.
- Any pip-installable libraries that your project requires must be listed, one per line, in a file called requirements.txt in the root of your project.
